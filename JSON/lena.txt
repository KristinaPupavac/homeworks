Lenna or Lena is the name given to a standard test image widely used in the field of image processing since 1973.
It is a picture of Lena Söderberg, shot by photographer Dwight Hooker, cropped from the centerfold of the November 1972 issue of Playboy magazine.
Nearly one year later, the same photograph can be seen to appear shortly in Sleeper, a science-fiction movie directed by Woody Allen. 
Given the nature of the image and its source, several academics have criticized its continued use in scientific publications and higher education as both sexist and unprofessional.
The spelling "Lenna" comes from the anglicisation used in the original Playboy article.
